# Hello!
I am Karan. I code and solve problems.

I am a Senior Backend Engineer at Celigo where I work on the core worker systems.
In my free time I tinker with 3D printing, raspberrypis, home servers and work on various different small side projects(uncompleted)  

I am also very interested in Game Programming. I have experimented with jMonkeyEngine, Unity, Godot and also SDL2. I am working on a small game using Rust and SDL2
